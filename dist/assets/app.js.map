“快乐时, 它使我神清气爽; 悲伤时, 它使我忘记忧伤, 孤独时, 它与我相伴; 友人相聚时, 它是我款待佳宾最好的饮品; 不饿时, 我会小酌一杯, 饥饿时, 我会大口的喝它。平时, 我绝不碰它, 除非, 我渴了……。” 年轻时代的成功奠定了Bollinger的骄傲传统。历经维多利亚女王、威尔士王子、爱德华七世、乔治五世、玛丽王后、乔治六世和王太后7位大不列颠君主，它一直独占英国皇家御用香槟的“封号”。',\n\t                    _react2.default.createElement(\n\t                      'h3',\n\t

黛安娜王妃车祸前与法耶德在巴黎里兹饭店(Ritz)用餐，Bollinger陪伴他们最后一晚。次日英伦玫瑰香消玉殒，成就了Bollinger所见证的最凄美之夜。当年查尔斯王子迎娶佳人，同样是Bollinger老酒斟满宫廷婚宴的郁金香杯。追溯其家事，这支香槟见证了近200年间英国王室贵族阶级的风云流变。'\n\t                  )\n\t                )\n\t

(Bollinger) 是法国香槟地区最优秀的生产商之一，1829年酒庄建成，1835年即出口第一批香槟酒至英国，是早先的为数不多的进入英国港口的香槟之一。1961年, 首席法兰西香槟公司的创始人 Lily Bollinger (莉丽. 鲍兰哲) 夫人在描述她饮用此酒的美妙感受时曾这样说过: “快乐时, 它使我神清气爽; 悲伤时, 它使我忘记忧伤, 孤独时, 它与我相伴; 友人相聚时, 它是我款待佳宾最好的饮品; 不饿时, 我会小酌一杯, 饥饿时, 我会大口的喝它。平时,\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t我绝不碰它, 除非, 我渴了……。” 年轻时代的成功奠定了Bollinger的骄傲传统。历经维多利亚女王、威尔士王子、爱德华七世、乔治五世、玛丽王后、乔治六世和王太后7位大不列颠君主，它一直独占英国皇家御用香槟的“封号”。\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>出镜率超高的香槟</h3> 几年前风靡英国的电视连续剧《绝对精彩》(Absolutely Fabulous)把Edina Monsoon和Patsy Stone两个40岁时髦女人的时髦生活方式带到了全世界，其中之一就是喝Bollinger。还有詹姆斯·邦德，不仅搞情报和追美女玩到出神入化，对香槟的口味也同样“高竿”。他从1973年开始喝Bollinger，一发难收。他在埃菲尔铁塔的旋转餐厅上喝Bollinger1975；他驾车逃命惊魂甫定，变魔术般变出一瓶Grande Annee 1988且借机向美丽的心理医生献吻；他“纵横天下”(The\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t\tworld is not enough)时曾与大美女苏菲·玛索共饮Bollinger1990…… 黛安娜王妃车祸前与法耶德在巴黎里兹饭店(Ritz)用餐，Bollinger陪伴他们最后一晚。次日英伦玫瑰香消玉殒，成就了Bollinger所见证的最凄美之夜。当年查尔斯王子迎娶佳人，同样是Bollinger老酒斟满宫廷婚宴的郁金香杯。追溯其家事，这支香槟见证了近200年间英国王室贵族阶级的风云流变。\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n
